Consider the set of all 5 element tuples of personality variation contained within the big 5 personality scale. 

If you take the Cartesian product of those different “settings” of personality with the set of every possible event able to be experienced by a human, that product is set of all possible personalities with which to embody when reacting to any possible circumstance. 

Define a one to one functional relation with the set of all circumstances as the domain, and the set of all personality traits as the codomain, where only those perfectly optimal personality traits for the given circumstance are included in the range of the function.

This function defines the optimal personality to embody when responding to any circumstance. 

Humans, limited by the compute constraint of their brains, cannot execute this function individually, let alone change to embody every personality variation at a moment's notice. 

Thus, humans accomplish the computation described in the preceding sentence by expressing that range of optimal personality across the population concurrently. Such that the optimal person to respond to a given circumstance can be identified and sent to task.
