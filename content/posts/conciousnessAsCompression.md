I have begun to think of consciousness as the magnitude of compression of external information within an object. Consciousness then would be a sliding scale, with certain "objects" being more conscious than others. I am unsure of how "accurate" this idea is, or even what it would be accurate to. But I hope that in this article I can expand upon this thought I've been considering lately. 

If we imagine the universe as a set containing all things within it (and ignoring for now the paradoxes such an idea implies), then we could think about this idea of consciousness as applying to each set element within.
The compression of external information I mentioned above would thus be the amount of *other set elements* a set element stores within itself. And if a very "large" set element is stored within, that would be a higher compression than if it were a very "small" set element. I am being intentionally vague about what "large" and "small" mean in this context because, in addition to not being entirely sure myself, I think that there are many metrics by which "large" and "small" could be measured by and still lend themselves well to the general idea conveyed in this argument.

With that in mind, I'll make some claims I think hold true given this premise. A book is more conscious than an ant. A laptop is more conscious than a book. A human is more conscious than a laptop. A family of humans is more conscious than a single human. 

That last claim is quite interesting, and I think highlights something rather interesting about this idea. That being the ability to define an "object" within this 'set of the universe' however we like. Thus, when considering the consciousness of an object, the object can be more formally thought of as a subset of the universe set. 

Some interesting implications now occur. 

Humans, all humans together as a single unit, are far more conscious than any single person. Perhaps this is why the idea of distributed cognition amongst a society makes sense. When we interact with the world, we are always relying on prior implementations of ideas well thought through. I did not invent the smartphone, nor did any single person, but I am able to rely on it for its various utilities. Humans as a single unit are able to apply their consciousness at a scale greater than is possible for any of its individual components. 

Another interesting idea is that I as a person now, in this immediate moment, am less conscious than I am when considered over time. The set of all my experiences are more conscious than any single one of them. That is, if each additional experience considered adds to the sum of consciousness of all the experiences. But perhaps an idea that conflicts with this one is that if I spend a majority of my life in a state dimly conscious, that may "lessen" the consciousness of all of my experiences. This may imply a need to take the "size" of the set element itself into account when considering its consciousness. Something like the ratio of the size of the external information stored within it over the size of the set element itself. Though I am not sure the difference between those two when viewing the issue from a set theoretic perspective. It will take some further thinking to differentiate them.
