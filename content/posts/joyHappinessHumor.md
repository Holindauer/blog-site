Happiness is often a goal. It is sought after and prized... "I just want to be happy"... Though, its somewhat dull and plain. There isn't much to happiness. Its something of an easy pleasure. Calm and relaxed happiness is comfortable and does not challenge a person. 

Then what is joy? Joy is not happiness. Words occupy valuable real estate in the lexicon, and two similar words never mean the same thing exactly. Else they'll collapse into each other as language evolves.

 So how joy is different? They're certainly in the same ballpark. Maybe happiness is within joy, a subset of a grander emotion. They're both experiences signifying something that feels positive and good. Though, often joy is unbearable. If it is true joy, that is. People are often *overjoyed*. Joy can be too much to handle. And can make you turn away in escape of its intensity. Joy is undeniably good, but it is painful. And can even feel as though a burden to hold onto and let encompass you.

And what is humor? Humor is complicated. Humor is strange. Why is it we laugh at all these different things?

When I was younger, I remember trying to describe different emotions in some detail and finding it was quite difficult. Emotion is a fundamental aspect of life. And it is the fundamentals which are hardest to know in the game of learning. 

I laugh when I am happy. I laugh when I am joyous. But I also laugh when I am sad, or angry, or grieving. It is a bit odd that both positive and negative emotional experiences can elicit laughter. Even, or rather, often in great extremes of those two. What is it that humor gets at?

I claim it has something to do with absurdity. Humor appears to be a way to regulate our emotions in face of the absurd. That appears to be why it is complicated, because to understand humor suggests you must know the absurd. And perhaps those absurd aspects of life, especially the ones that really get at us, are the most indescribable. Though, indescribability does seem to be a description. I am reminded that *nondescript* is my favorite word. It is paradox, and for that it makes me laugh. Then, laughter, it seems, is how we express our feelings of humor. We laugh and it brings us relief. Humor is a release of the terror of absurdity through the action of laughter. 

For that reason, humor gets use through the difficult in life. Humor is often the only way to be serious, in those situations too serious to bear.

Laughter is short lived though, it is not particularly productive in times of great trial. Its a positive feeling, but its almost as if it *pauses* those difficulties; lightens them for a moment so you may catch your breath. Laughing at something negative may alleviate its intensity, brings you down to feelings of simple happiness. But only for brief moments. This is true also for moments *too* positive. Laughter alleviates those overjoyed. But it does not seem to alleviate those who are *just* happy. 

Perhaps this offers some further insight into happiness. Happiness is not intense enough to require laughter. There is less meaning in happiness, because there is less need to act. And meaning, afterall, is what drives you to act. More meaningful things motivate you to move. Joy and Sorrow need be acted on, they occupy a portion of the set of experiences life has to offer that are fuller, richer than basic pleasures. They are more fulfilling, less comfortable, and requiring greater agility in action and strategy. 

Perhaps that *pause* laughter facilitates allows you to fit the breadth of that mild happiness into those more intense experiences. Letting you have both.

A strange thing too about laughter, is those driven by evil also laugh. An evil villains laugh. Strangely villains are often quite humorous, though they are not funny when their evil is known. 

*Funny*, appears to be aligned with humor that is good, or at least not bad. And humor that lacks being funny, is only tragic. It may be that evil requires laughter, because it is the only way to relief the pain of the corruption that evil inflicts on the mind when one decides to act against their conscience.
