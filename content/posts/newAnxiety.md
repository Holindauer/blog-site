I've been thinking a bit lately about the prevelance of anxiety today. It's quite interesting that chronic anxiety has seemed to have grown into somewhat of an aspect of culture. No doubt, the constant influx of new technology is correlated with this trend.

It seems the broader conversation of this topic has centered mainly around social media. It's well understood by those who regularly use social media that doing so implicates a significant degree of anxiety. Compared to three years ago, there is even much less hesitation to claim that social media is an addictive activity, not unlike gambling. Social media has a strange quality to it that is unlike most other social meeting grounds. That being that when you post on social media, you are displaying your thoughts to everyone you know. The amount of things that you can say to every person you know at the same time and have it be appropriate to the context of your relationship with each person is quite low. As such, there is a great degree of overthinking that goes into crafting oneself into a person that can be viewed in a positive light by all such persons at once. Such a persona is an unhealthy ideal that breeds great anxiety in self comparison with. 

The above ideas are well and good and seem intuitively accurate. Though, I think there is a subtler cause of anxiety that underpins these more social considerations. That being that the sheer complexity of life is increasing exponentially with time. Each of us have most likely consumed more published information in the last week than our parents did in their entire adolescence (assuming your parents lived their adolescence sometime in the last century). The amount of readily avaiable (and impossible to avoid) information today is unprecedented.

My hypothesis on rising anxiety is predicated on a theory of daily mental capacity. The mind is a machine, it runs on fuel and is built of physical parts. There is a limitation on the amount of computation that can be expected out of such a machine in a given time period. The mind just so happens to be a system and no system is perfectly efficient. 

This limitation on daily cognitive throughput can be thought of intuitively as your mind recieving a computation paycheck each day. You can spend it on whatever computation you want, but your choice of how you spend that paycheck determines your output. It should also be said that if you don't spend all that computation by the end of the day, you lose it. Each day your mental paycheck is replenished, but it cannot be stored up.

Because of the amount of information available today, we are increasingly finding ourselves in situations where we spend our entire paycheck before the day ends. This is not a bad thing in and of itself. Using up your paycheck just means that you are not wasting it. Though, if you use it up prematurely, then you'll stall up in responce to new information and challenging circumstance. 

Due to the vast breadth of information available, it has also become difficult to determine which activities are worthwhile to pursue. One can spin their wheels attempting to figure out what to do, spending their computation check on feelings of aimlessness and neurotic thoughts. It is this overload of information passing through individuals that I think is responsible for this new anxiety. Anxiety is, afterall, what you feel when you have many ways to go, but no idea which to move into.
