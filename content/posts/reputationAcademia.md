## New Ideas Require Looking Stupid

One of the interesting things about individuals who invent radically new and useful ideas is that in hindsight, their inventions seem so blatantly obvious that it seems anyone could have thought of them. However, that notion of obviousness convieniently glosses over all the infrastructure that now exists around such ideas. Infrastructure that allows once radical ideas to be comfortably commonplace and easy to use. Any radical idea that sticks around must offer a magnitude of utility that warrants the amount of infrastructure required to properly integrate it into the common space of ideas/technology/society/life. That is not an easy task.

The internet is one such idea. The entire world has adopted the internet idea. But in order for that adoption to have happened, the entire world had to invest heavily. At one point the idea of stringing fiberglass cables across the bottom of the ocean to connect us with our friends across the pond seemed absurd. And rightfully so, with the amount of capital required for such an endeavor, skepticism is only sane. 

This is not just a discussion of technology, but ideas in general. An example more in the socio-cultural domain is that of cubist imagery. Artists tend to be a bit nutty. And it takes a nut case like Picasso to think up the types of images he painted. Modern art is a field of beauty subject to much ridicule, warranted as it often comes across rather juvenile. Though after much time, certain styles stick, and only in hindsight may their utility seem obvious. The flat figures of Picasso are commonplace in modern cartoons and graphic design. They offer a simple, straight to the point, visual communication of ideas. That specific style of imagery provided a dimmension of utility that had not been explored prior to its inception. Its utility in society was of a great enough magnitude that it warranted the cost of adoption. 

There are more examples, but I think the two mentioned seed the issue well enough. The difficulty of incentivising people to share their new, radical, and *potentially* useful ideas is that, they will inevitably be subject to being misunderstood and ridiculed. This is not a bad thing, as if a new ideas are to be adopted, they ought to be useful. It goes without saying that they also ought not be detrimental. And so ridicule too is important is important for weeding out the ideas that are genuinely stupid. 

The nuance here is that to commit to the leap of faith of saying "Here is my idea, I believe in my idea, I think it could be really useful!" you *must be someone who is willing to do so!* 

Duh! Why is that an issue? Well, the difficulty is that only those individuals whom are especially "out there" will be willing to take the chance of pubicizing their "out there" ideas. 

The issue runs deep for timid thinkers with the capacity of dreaming up new practical ideas. A serious fear of looking stupid by means saying something wrong may be enough to dissaude bright people away from applying their thinking. 

Idea creation can roughly be split up into two categories. That of *generation* and *refinment*. The generaton phase is when half formed ideas come into being. It is important to recognize that an idea is a loose form. Ideas point to concepts, but unless tested against other ideas, they remain unrealized notions. Fear is a powerful force that can lead to a repression of the thought for the sake of comfort. A culture that fears looking stupid dampens the collective talent pool, and lowers our innovative throughput.

Willingness to express esoteric thought requires that the expresser knows they are safe to do so. Or at least that expressing the idea is more important than any discomfort felt.

What I will describe in the next section is a proposition for how the "comfort with looking stupid barrier" may be lowered by implementing a commit-reveal citation scheme with the ultimate goal of usurping institutional academia.

## How Best to Promote Looking Stupid for the Sake of Useful Idea Propogation

In the quest for innovation, it is often important to remember why certain solutions came to be in the first place. We often forget that everything around us, aside from nature, was first created to solve some problem once grappled with. Solutions to problems eventually expire. The reason they expire is because unrelated problem are solved and their solutions serve a dual purpose in solving unrelated problems. 

Take the Hotel/Airbnb story as example. Hotels first sprung up to solve the problem that overnight travelers faced of irregular quality of inns. A well known Hotel chain could offer a guaranteed uniform quality across locations. Airbnb was able to usurp the Hotel's dominance over the issue of inns by using the internet, a recently developed solution/tool. The internet allowed overnight travelers to assess an inns quality prior to having paid for the night. As well as offering wide variety for where one could stay, something less possible with hotels.

I believe there is opportunity for an analogous seige of solution dominance held by institutional academia in the field of idea generation and refinement. Academia was invented to solve the issue of the expensiveness of scientific research. A book was once a pricey item, among other needed tools for the scientific effort. The only way humans could afford scientific instruments was by pooling capital into large institutions. In the time since, many important innovations have invalidated such measures. 

Self study in certain fields using the internet has almost entirely eroded the need for an education from a university. However, development of new ideas is still largely dominated by large historical institutions. Part of this is again the issue of expense. Though only for fields that require cutting edge technical instruments. For fields with lower price tags, the main issue is that of credibility and collaboration. 

Game theoretically speaking, collaboration is a risk. To avoid collaborating haphazardly, credibility is used as a counterbalance in the cost benefit analysis. A useful thing about generating ideas in a university is that your ideas are peer reviewed. Peer reviewed ideas offer credibility, but at the risk of centralized corruption. Ideas too far outside the overton window, but potentially useful may be discarded before they are given a chance. We have seen this in recent years in the humanities from political polarization. 

The dream here is to develop a system that can usurp institutional academia's dominance over peer review by providing a way to credit thinkers in an immutable way using blockchain. Imagine git, but for research. Contributors to research are associated by their Ethereum address, and the record of their contribution is written permanently into the blockchain. 

This will also allow communities of thought to choose which middle men they desire to drive peer review. Community consensus over quality of expertise will thus dictate authority. Which will prevent the situation of academic bias impeding the R&D process by enabling free movement between systems of differing bias.



As well, we also want to maximize the amount of people publicizing new information in order to maximize our collective likelihood of finding new useful ideas within the space of unexplored ideas. This is where the idea of *fear of looking stupid* comes back in.

It is a sufficient condition that if large amounts of robust ideas are well propgated, then creators of such information are publicizing their information openly and without fear of the consequences. As previously mentioned, thinkers without such fear don't face any issue in this regard. But timid, more reserved thinkers to. Not wanting to looking stupid is a major bottleneck. 

However, its more complicated than just not wanting to look stupid. More generally its the desire to protect ones reputation that accounts for this. To quote Robert Greene, "So much depends on repuation, guard it with your life". At the end of the day, our ability to take part in society at all is governed by that which our repuation does not restrict us from doing. If an idea has any degree of reputation related degredation associated to it, it will factor into how much someone is not willing to say it. While the kooky artist may be fine with such risk, it does not stand for all. 

Another important layer of tension here is that protecting ones reputation is not as simple as just trying to *not wanting to be known as someone with undesirable qualities*. It is also *wanting to be known for positive qualities*. The greatest tension here is fundamentally an incentive issue. People don't want to be known for their failures, but do want to be known for their success, verifiably so.

Anonymity helps in getting people to say controversial things. Internet trolls prove this. But if you say something that ends up being useful, you'll want to be credited. However, verifiable crediting doesn't work well anonymity. 

How might you allow anonymity while also maintaining the ability to credit people? That is the solution I am proposing. Imagine again our idea of git for research hosted on ethereum. As it stands, we have only considered this idea as being a public record of research versioning and contributor tracking hosted immutibly on Ethereum. Now, add to the equation a commit-reveal scheme. When a researcher begins some research, they associate their name and Ethereum address to the research in a private way. Then, they'll have the ability to reveal their true identity as being the contributor to the research in question. Thus, timid thinkers can work in secrecy AND reap the benefits of accurate credibility and peer review if they wish to.

The issue, which I am still trying to work out, is falsely crediting individuals who are not associated with the research. This would be in the context of a false information campaign. I will post about this problem soon.
