This is an idea I have been toying with for some time now. I'm not sure to what degree of accuracy it has. But it has served as a useful frame of thought. 


The universe exists most fundamentally as a Tensor of infinite dimension. Each axis contains all possible varience. And there are infinite axes. This can be thought of intuitively as the vector space where potential/possibility is located. This is the "largest/most inclusive" structure of the universe. I will refer to this idea as the Tensor at Infinity. 

This means that the universe is fundamentally a data structure, modeled by us as the Tensor at Infinity. This data is potential, which does not actively exist. The Tensor at Infinity is a sort of dormant entity that can be likened to mathematics always existing/governing physical entities, though not anywhere "physically". Each of its elements and axes can exist, but only under certain circumstance. They must be brought into existence via computation.

We have now stumbled upon our second datastructure, the computational universe. I am using computational to mean that the universe has a "state" that "changes". 

The set of all possible states of the computational universe can be thought of as the set of all finite subsets of the Tensor at Infinity. A subset/state of the TAI being finite means that it has a finite number of axis, and a finite number of elements per axis.

Thus, state changes in the computational universe exist as changes in the number of axes and/or elements per axis. This does not speak to how this computation is computed. Only its nature. 

I am unsure whether this idea serves better as a model for the universe or the brain.
