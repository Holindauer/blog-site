I've been thinking about the nature of summarization at the level of words. A strange thing about language is that different words convey different amounts of information. Each word in a language appears to exist upon a spectrum of two ends, that being precision and generality. I claim that *optimal summarization is the process of finding words for an idea that both convey the meaning of the idea, as well as expressing it at a level of precision such that only the most relevant information for implicating action towards the reason for communicating is conveyed.* 

Ideas can be represented in sentences. However, there is not just one sentence for expressing a given idea. In fact, it can be claimed that any idea can be expressed in infinite ways. This is why summarization is possible. There are ways I can say the same thing using different words. The same meaning can be conveyed despite all elementary components of the communication being different. 

Consider the set of all sentences that convey the same idea. There will be some sentences in this set that convey completely different aspects of the idea. The explicit literal content of two sentences might be mutually disjoint. Though, they can still convey the same concept via partial representations of it. For example, a sentence about a tire and a sentence about a steering wheel are concerned with different aspects of the idea of a car. The broader concept of a car is preserved within these two sentences through an implicit context they both exist in the intersection of. 

Ideas are complicated and there are many aspects to them. What is strange about language is that there are words to describe complicated ideas at both the highest level of generalization as well as for the most precise details of it. Words somehow have the ability to describe these varying levels of precision and deep abstraction using very similar amounts of information when communicating. An atom can be described in a sentence, just as a galaxy can be described in a sentence. Somehow language can efficiently move between vastly different levels of abstraction and implicit information with ease. 

This results in an interesting question: How should one go about picking the right words to use given that the same idea can be expressed in so many different ways? I think the answer lies in finding the optimal level of precision/generality for conveying only the relevant parts of an idea for the particular reason for expressing it. 

People communicate to express meaning to others or themselves. Meaning is relevant information that will change the way you act. Meaning exists in the context of those axioms that define a person's value structure. To say that a person acts in response to meaningful information is essentially saying that the information implies that for that person's value structure to be adhered to, an appropriate response to a newly realized context must be enacted. 

When one expresses an idea, they do so because they are attempting to convey relevant information to an audience in order to better inform their actions towards this end. An idea can be expressed to someone in extremely inefficient ways. This is often done by expressing context that is irrelevant. An idea can still be gotten across in an inefficient way, but it detracts from the goal of informing others actions when done so. 

Thus, to optimally summarize an idea, all irrelevant details of the idea should be hidden in generalizations. Consider if a glass has fallen and shattered on the ground. If I wish to tell this to someone so they don't cut their feet, it would convey the idea that a glass has shattered if I described its shattered molecular structure on the floor in exact detail. However, it would be optimally precise for my intention to say "The glass fell". All the irrelevant details, and even the implication of danger are conveyed implicitly within that sentence.
