# Why a Decentralized Marketplace for Machine Learning?

The question of who should be in charge of Artificial Intelligence has quickly become one of the most discussed and most important ethical issues in the world. Machine Learning is not new, but only recently has its economic power become so immediately apparent that inquiry into regulation has grown into a household conversation. 

There are two prominent positions in this argument. 

- The first position calls for resctriction on access to AI, suggesting heavy regulatory action is required to prevent powerful AI tools from "falling into the wrong hands". 

- The second position rebutts this claim, arguing that centralized regulatory bodies having final say over who may use these technologies at minimum stifles innovation. At worst, such centralization provides a risk to freedom and the potential for those in charge of regulation to seige totalitarian control. 

This project is philosophically opposed to that first position. Intelligence and Truthful Information are the most important weapons a population has to arm themselves against governmental overreach. Modern AI is both of these at a scale never seen before and compounding at an exponential rate. 

As of this writing, while not governmentally regulated, access to AI is primarily centralized in the hands of big tech companies. This is primarily attributed to the massive energy, data, and compute requirements needed for training state of the art models from scratch. While access to such resources is currently necessary for training, this will not always be the case. The hunt is on for more efficient algorithms and the arc of history suggest this will come sooner rather than later. In the 1950's, only governments and universities could afford computers. Now you can buy a smart phone for twenty dollars. 

The release of Llama2 by Meta as well as efficient transfer learning algorithms like QLoRa are powerful examples of the democratization of AI being possible. With regards to democratization, Llama shines brighter than being able to use GPT-3.5 for free. This is because the weights, architecture, and ability to fine tune are open-sourced and in the hands of the people. However there is a problem here...

Fine tuning a Quantized Llama-7B to be a customer service chatbot for your ecommerce website is easy-peasy if *you actually know what you're doing*. However actually knowing what your doing, depending on what you're doing, could require specialized knowledge on machine learning theory, deep learning strategies, and PyTorch. As well as access to a single GPU. 

Thus we have reached the current purpose of this marketplace. Of the democratized AI tools available today for training and fine-tuning, all of which require technical expertise on how to use them. This is great for those who have those skills, but effectively blockades access for those who desire machine learning solutions for their business/research. Access may become available for this group, but at the risk of being provided exclusively by a centralized power. 

By hosting a marketplace for machine learning on the etheruem blockchain, access to AI for those with non-technical backgrounds is democratized in decentralized way. Such a marketplace provides a way to unite model training experts and those desiring models, fully leveraging the security and transparency provided by ethereum smart contracts.
